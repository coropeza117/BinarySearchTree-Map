# BinarySearchTree-Map

-Description

Welcome to the BinarySearchTree-Map project! This repository contains the implementation of a generic "Map" container class using a binary search tree with parent pointers. The primary goal of this project is to provide a fast and efficient way to manage key-value pairs, offering functionality similar to the standard Map interface in Java's collection framework.

-Accomplishments

Since its completion, the BinarySearchTree-Map project has achieved several significant milestones:

    • Efficient Key-Value Storage: The core of this project is a binary search tree with parent pointers. This data structure allows for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs. The use of parent pointers enhances the iteration process, making it faster and more convenient.

    • Comprehensive Map Interface: The implemented Map class closely follows the Java collection framework's Map interface. It provides essential methods such as size(), isEmpty(), containsKey(), containsValue(), get(), put(), remove(), putAll(), clear(), keySet(), values(), and entrySet(). 
    These methods empower developers to manage data in a table-like structure with ease.

    • Iterator with Parent Pointers: The project includes an iterator that leverages the parent pointers within the binary search tree. This iterator enables efficient traversal of the map's key-value pairs and ensures that operations like remove() are performed correctly.

    • Maintaining Data Consistency: The project addresses the challenge of handling potential null parameters and ensuring that key uniqueness is maintained. It provides a robust mechanism to handle different scenarios when adding, modifying, or removing entries.

    • Testing Suite: The repository includes an extensive testing suite with unit tests, ADT tests, efficiency tests, and random tests. These tests help validate the correctness and efficiency of the implemented Map class, ensuring that it behaves as expected in various scenarios.

    • In-Depth Documentation: The codebase is thoroughly documented, providing insights into the implementation details, data structures, and algorithms used. Developers can easily understand and extend the project as needed.

    • Reusable Components: Developers can reuse components of this project for their own applications that require efficient key-value storage with binary search tree characteristics.

In summary, the BinarySearchTree-Map project offers a powerful and efficient solution for managing key-value pairs. It provides a comprehensive Map interface, utilizes parent pointers for faster iteration, and ensures data consistency. The thorough testing and documentation make it a reliable choice for developers seeking an optimized map data structure.
